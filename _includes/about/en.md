# ABOUT ME
Hi there 👋, I'm Aryo.
a.k.a oreo.

- 👨‍🎓 I am a student at [Universitas Ciputra Makassar](https://www.ciputramakassar.ac.id/).
- 💜 I like pretty things. Aesthetically pleasing things to see.
- ✨ I'm currently interested in becoming a front-end developer.

💿 Running Windows 11 as my daily driver. I hope one day i got the courage to switch to Linux entirely. That or my windows got wiped out completely whether by the SSD burning or mysteriously wiped out (i hope). Whichever comes first.

### FOSS Enthusiast 🔓
I like my software like my coffee—preferably open-source, but I won't refuse a Starbucks. I'm a FOSS enthusiast, but i don't mind proprietary.
